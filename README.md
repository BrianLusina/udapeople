In this project, you will prove your mastery of the following learning objectives:

- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.

## Cloud Formation Templates

[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates can be found [here](./infra). These aid in setting up infrastructure for your running application. Ensure you have the right set of permissions for AWS CLI to use when automating this process. Preferrably, have a configured machine user or a bot that has administrative access to your AWS account. DO NOT share or commit these credentials to a VCS.

Each cloud formation configuration is under a relevant folder.
